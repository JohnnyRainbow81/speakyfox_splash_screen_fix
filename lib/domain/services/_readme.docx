In some cases, I found it to be practical to let the services also implement the repository interface (which were planned to be implemented
 solely by the repository impls), where the services add no further functionality but only forward the answers from the 
 repository impls 1:1 to the calling client (= to the viewmodels mostly). I did this just for practical development reasons 
 and to present a consistent API to the calling client. 

Yes, in such a case the service layer is unnecessary, but on the other side we stay consistent with this call flow:

viewmodel > service > repository interface > repository_impl > client 

And I think consistency is more important than shortcuts in the long term, regarding to code maintenance and understandability.

Also: 
 If the API of the Services for the calling client will change in future, then we can throw out the repository interface implementation and freely change the Service APIs.
