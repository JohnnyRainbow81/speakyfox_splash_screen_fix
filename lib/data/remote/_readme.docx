1) The remote clients here unfortunately cannot use the same repository-interface like the repositoryImpls. 
Caused by this:

CourseService method: 
Future<Course> getById(String id) 

RepositoryImpl method: 
Future<Response<CourseDto>> getById(String id)

The additional "Response"-type messes up a proper common interface between these layers. I cannot find a way how you can make these compatible.

2) Sometimes we need to hide "Response"- and "Headers"-classes in the import of dio-library, because otherwise we get a naming-clash between 
Dio, Retrofit and our own classes
